                You're allowed to put constants in an interface. By doing so, you guarantee that any
                class implementing the interface will have access to the same constant.
                By placing the constants right in the interface, any class that implements the
                interface has direct access to the constants, just as if the class had inherited them.
                You need to remember one key rule for interface constants. They must always be
                public static final
                So that sounds simple, right? After all, interface constants are no different from
                any other publicly accessible constants, so they obviously must be declared public,
                static, and final. But before you breeze past the rest of this discussion, think
                about the implications: Because interface constants are defined in an interface,
                they don't have to be declaredas public, static, or final. They must be
                public, static, and final, but you don't have to actually declare them that way.Just
                as interface methods are always public and abstract whether you say so in the code
                or not, any variable defined in an interface must be—and implicitly is—a publi
